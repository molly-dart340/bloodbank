      <br>
      <p>Germantown Bloodbank is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) community asset located in the old
         Germantown Hospital at La Salle University. It is responsible for providing safe, available and quick blood
         draws.
         We are in partnership with Einstein Hopsital. Safety of the blood supply is our top
         priority. Every unit
         of blood undergoes more than a dozen tests to ensure it is safe for transfusion. Regardless of
         where the blood is donated in our service area, all blood samples are delivered via a
         courier to a trusted partner of
         Einstein's.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We welcome the members of the community to become donors and are extremely grateful to
         all of our employees, friends from the community and students who assist our Blood Bank. You can
         schedule an appointment below to donate blood. We provide a day of the week you can
         choose and three or more times that may
         be convenient. Walk-ins are always welcome
         but on weekends, holidays and after 4 pm on weekdays please contact
         us.</p>

   <!-- Makes use of accordians and help was sourced from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp-->
   <br>
   <button class="accordion">How much blood is taken during a blood donation?</button>
   <div class="panel">
      <p>A little less than one pint of blood is taken for each whole blood donation.</p>
   </div>

   <button class="accordion">How much blood is in my body?</button>
   <div class="panel">
      <p>The average adult has between 9-12 pints of blood, depending on the personâ€™s weight. To better understand your
         blood volume use the resources below.</p>
   </div>

   <button class="accordion">How long will it take my body to replenish my lost blood?</button>
   <div class="panel">
      <p>The blood volume is typically replaced within 24 hours. Red blood cells take between four to six weeks for
         complete replacement, which is why the FDA requires an eight-week wait between blood donations. Your body will
         not be affected adversely by the loss of the pint of blood.</p>
   </div>

   <button class="accordion">How long does donating blood take?</button>
   <div class="panel">
      <p>If you schedule a possible appointment on our form on the front page, the entire process will take about 30-40
         minutes (for whole blood donations). The actual donation takes about five to seven minutes.</p>
